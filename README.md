# Schedule Widget

This widget can keep track of your school schedule! With fully customizable schedules and text, it's an extremely useful addition to your home screen. 

To download, simply download the Scriptables app, create a new script, and copy-paste this into a new script. Then, add a widget to your home screen and set it to the script you just created. That's it!
