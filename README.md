# Schedule Tracker by @ben.tastic_

This widget can keep track of your school schedule! With fully customizable schedules and text, it's an extremely useful addition to your home screen.

**Current Version:** 1.0.0

**UPDATE:** The new purple and teal weeks are very confusing! I have updated this widget with full purple and teal week support.

# How to download

1. Download the Scriptable app from the App Store 
2. Create a new script
3. Copy-paste everything on [this page](https://github.com/EpicoTortuga/ScheduleWidget/blob/master/WidgetCode) (for regular schedule), or on [this page](https://github.com/EpicoTortuga/ScheduleWidget/blob/master/WidgetCode-PurpleTeal) (for purple/teal schedule) into a new script.
4. **Note:** the purple/teal widget will only work for the currently announced weeks. It will not work before, or after, these days. I will regularily update the widget to keep up with schedule announcements. Contact me, or follow my Instagram, to know when you should change out your widget code!
5. *(Optional)* Edit the beginning part of the script to the preferences you prefer.
6. Add a widget to your home screen and set it to the script you just created.

That's it! Your widget should be completely ready.
